# Domain Driven Design

## Ubiquitous Language

A language that is developed and shared by all stakeholders. It is used to create and implement the Model.

## The Model

The model should model those aspects of our domain that are necessary to solve the problem and leave out those that are not.
The model must be coupled to it's implementation.
Developing the model is an iterative Process. The implementation will influence the model and vice versa.

### Entities

Entities are determined by identity.
Identity is usually implemented via IDs.

### Value Objects

Value Objects are determined by their qualia.

### Services
