# Normalization

We normalize a database to:

1. Reduce data redundancy
2. Increase data integrity
3. Thereby making it **easy to change** the database structure

## Normal Forms

### 1st Normal Form
Make Cells Atomic. Cells can't have tables as values.

### 2nd Normal Form
Columns depend on a single primary key or the entire candidate key.

### 3rd Normal Form
Non keys only describe the primary key.
