Have your story prepared. Your chance to present yourself, Projects, Education, go deeper into some technical stuff you did to impress. Technical challenges and complexity (ie good considerations of tradeoffs memory vs time, choice of architectural patterns like MVC OO different APIs. ggf technical leadership, impact. Maybe support it with some visuals, like whiteboard drawing. Bring up the topic of design patterns at some point of the interview
Don't loose the interviewer, check if they're able to follow, are interested.

It s about HOW you solve stuff, not if. You are interviewed regarding your future roll in the company, regarding developing towards a senior position, not purely for your value as a junior developer.
Know your tradeoff between different algorithms and data structures
Practice whiteboard writing beforehand

Start with an overview, consider tradeoffs of recursive vs iterative solutions, wich one is simpler to read, recursive might be limited by stackspace, consider different data structures (do you need to create your own, or can you leverage what s already there?) and algorithms
If you go for recursive solutions, make sure to ask for the size of the problem to avoid stack overflows and switch to an iterative solution (bound by memory size) if necessary
Bring your own whiteboard pen.

Stay positive, no matter what happens. You will get evaluated not only on your skill, but also on your personality, team fit, etc.
Never ask, what the answer to a question was that you didn't get
If you do get the chance to grab lunch, get lunch :-)

## Algorithms to know
1. Depth first search (stack)
2. Breadth first search (queue)
3. Matching Parenthesis Problem (stack)
4. Hashtables (to keep track of something ie hashing or memoization, for O(1) lookups)
5. Variable/Pointer manipulation (eg find the longest palindromic substring)
6. Pointer traversal: Reversing a linked list (detecting cycles, removing duplicates)
7. Sorting concepts and their runtimes, differences in runtimes on sorted vs unsorted structures
8. Recursion
9. Custom Data Structures and classes (eg a suffix tree)
10. Binary Search

Learn flood-fill, tree-traversal, heaps, trees and tries, hash tables and sets, graphs

## Questions to ask
* How are your Teams structured?
* How do you make decisions?
* How are you testing? What are your rules, requirements for testing?
* How are you logging? What are your rules, requirements for logging?
