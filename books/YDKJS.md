# You don't know JS

- An ES6 module is a singleton.
- `for..of` and the spread operator `...` consume iterators. They can be used with _iterables_ as well.
  In that case the iterator protocol creates an iterator instance from the iterable, that will be used for consumption.
- The enclosing scope of a closure doesn't have to be a function.
