## Visual and Accoustic 

There are lots of similarities between visual and accoustic design.

- Size, position, space, shape and colour vs. loudness, pitch and colour/shape
- Creating space: making room in the frequency spectrum.
- Creating hierarchy: through contrast, loudness, colour
- blending vs contrast
- subtract to emphasize (EQ)
